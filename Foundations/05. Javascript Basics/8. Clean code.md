### Knowledge Check
- Keeping Your Programming Code Clean
  1. Revise Your Logic Before Coding
  2. Clearly Expose the Structure of the Page
  3. Use the Correct Indentation
  4. Write Explanatory Comments
  5. Avoid Abusing Comments
  6. Avoid Extremely Large Functions
  7. Use Naming Standards for Functions and Variables
  8. Treat Changes with Caution
  9. Avoid Indiscriminate Mixing of Coding Languages
  10. Summarize Your Imports
- Write your code as if comments didn't exist (self-explaining).
- Comments can never be replaced by code alone.
